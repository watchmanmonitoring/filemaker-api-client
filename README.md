The main feature of the Filemaker™ Pro solution is to keep a fresh copy of the Watchman Monitoring data in a local file that can be built to act on the data in ways specific to your company's needs.  This can include certain filtering of the plugin results as an example, but more importantly your system can be tied to your CRM or accounting so that automated reporting and communications can be effected and for those who have the ability to work in Filemaker™ Pro, the results can be productive in the extreme.
